# unBlur
Mod for Kerbal Space Program that allows fixing blurry UI textures without renaming or modifying actual texture files in the installation.
Accomplishes this by providing a mechanism for disabling mipmaps on textures in KSP's GameDatabase.

See the [forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=184268) for a comprehensive guide.
